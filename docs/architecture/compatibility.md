# Compatibility Matrix — Versioned Contracts

> **Status:** Living — update whenever any contract version bumps.
> Mixed-version sync policy: [ADR-0016](decisions/0016-mixed-version-sync-policy.md).

Crosscue is no longer a single binary: it is an app, a sync format, a server,
and a widget that evolve at different speeds. This page is the one place that
states every versioned contract, who depends on it, and what must stay
compatible with what.

## The five contracts

| # | Contract | Current version | Written by | Read by | Compatibility rule | Bump procedure |
|---|----------|-----------------|------------|---------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Local DB schema** (Drift) | **v7** (`app_database.dart` → `schemaVersion`) | The app | The same app | Migrations are additive and run forward-only on upgrade; each historical step has a migration test | Increment `schemaVersion`, add migration + test (checklist in `app_database.dart`) |
| 2 | **Sync blob envelope** | **schema 1** (`SyncBlob.currentSchemaVersion`) | Every synced device | Every synced device | Readers ignore unknown payload fields; blobs with a *newer* schema are skipped (`decode()` → null). Prefer additive payload fields over schema bumps — see ADR-0016 for the mixed-version policy | Bump `currentSchemaVersion` only under ADR-0016's flag-day rules |
| 3 | **Worker D1 schema** | migrations **0001–0006** | Worker deploys | Deployed Worker | Migrations must be backward-compatible with the **currently deployed** Worker (additive), because migrate runs before deploy; never edit an applied migration | New numbered SQL file; `migrate → deploy`, staging before prod (DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| 4 | **Worker HTTP API** | unversioned paths (contract: `API.md`) | Worker | Every shipped app version | Worker changes must stay compatible with the **oldest app version still in the field**, unless that version is deliberately retired via the min-client lever (see below) | Additive request/response changes by default; removals require raising `MIN_SUPPORTED_CLIENT` first |
| 5 | **Widget payload** | `crosscue_widget_v1`, `"version": 1` | App (`HomeWidgetService`) | iOS widget extension + Android `CrosscueWidgetProvider` (#223) — either may be older than the app, or newer after a partial update | Additive only: new optional keys/rows; never repurpose `version` for additive fields | New key name (`_v2`) only for breaking shape changes |

Related but unversioned: the app↔extension App Group route token
(`pendingIntentRoute`, additive string tokens by design — see
`ios-app-intents.md`) and the export/import backup file from the privacy
screen (treat as contract #1's serialized form; verify import of old exports
when bumping #1).

## Support-window statements

These are the guarantees to preserve when changing anything above:

1. **Old app + new Worker:** must keep working. Deploy order is always
   Worker-before-app-release, and the Worker supports every fielded client
   until a minimum-client mechanism exists.
2. **New app + old data:** a fresh build must open any database produced by
   any released version (forward-only migrations, each step tested).
3. **Two devices, different app versions, same sync account:** both must
   converge or fail *visibly* — never fork silently. Today's behavior and
   the target policy are in ADR-0016.
4. **App + older widget extension** (or vice versa): the widget renders
   whatever optional rows it understands; absent/extra keys are not errors.

## Minimum-client lever (#256 — shipped)

Contract #4's "support the oldest fielded client" rule now has a deliberate
escape hatch:

- The app sends `X-Crosscue-Client: <platform>/<semver>` on every Challenge
  Boards request (since v1.4.3).
- The Worker's optional `MIN_SUPPORTED_CLIENT` var (per-env in
  `wrangler.toml`; unset everywhere by default = no enforcement) rejects
  missing/unparsable/lower versions with a structured `426 client_too_old`
  on every route.
- The app renders 426 as a persistent "Update Crosscue" card on the
  Challenge tab; everything offline is unaffected (the degradability
  principle, `PRODUCT.md`), and queued results are held, not dropped.

**Rules for using it:** raising the minimum is a deliberate, logged decision
— staging first, release-notes mention, and remember it also cuts off app
versions that predate the header (< v1.4.3). Until the dual-host/v1.4.3
generation dominates the field, leave it unset.

## External dependency: Crosshare (single point of failure)

`CrosshareDownloader` is an HTTP + HTML scraper, and three user-visible
features sit on it: the home "Past puzzles" section, daily auto-download, and
**Challenge Boards eligibility** (`crosshare_daily_mini` is the only accepted
result source). A Crosshare markup change degrades all three at once.

**Degradation policy (stale-but-honest):**

- Already-imported puzzles, streaks, stats, and existing board standings are
  local/server data and must remain fully usable during an outage.
- Fetch failures must never crash or block the home screen; the Past-puzzles
  section shows what is already downloaded plus a quiet failure state — never
  fabricated content.
- Challenge result submission already queues offline (`ChallengeResultOutbox`)
  and flushes later; a download outage means *no new eligible puzzle*, which
  boards experience as a quiet day, not an error.

**Risk-reduction tasks (tracked, not yet built):**

1. Scheduled CI canary (weekly cron) running the live fetch/parse against
   crosshare.org, opening an issue on failure.
2. Ask Crosshare about a stable feed/API (license approval already on file —
   `CONVENTIONS.md` source table).
3. Longer term: a Worker-side canonical puzzle-id registry (D4 in
   [`../challenge-boards-159-breakdown.md`](../challenge-boards-159-breakdown.md))
   to decouple board eligibility from client-side scraping success.
